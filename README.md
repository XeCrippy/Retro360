# Retro360 WinUI C++
Xbox 360 RGH/Jtag modding tool. Mainly focused on single player/offline games. 

This project started out just for testing. I was making a c++ version of JRPC.dll (for RTM tools) and testing on a few different UI frameworks. Originally was using Dear ImGui & D3D11 but liked the look and feel of WinUI better. 

Current Features:
* Achievement Manager - Unlock all achievements, unlock individual achievements (optionally with custom timestamp), unlock all avatar awards, unlock all gamer pics
* File Manager - Browse, launch, delete, send, and receive files/directories
* Memory Search - cheat engine style search tool inspired by XeClutch's Xbox 360 Cheat Engine and X360 Trainer Tool
* Some random game mods. Focusing mainly on single player games and games that don't have much available for them.

Info:
* Using WinUI 3 in Visual Studio 2026 Insiders written in C++.
* This is mostly educational, trying to learn more about c++ coming from c#
* This is a work in progress and pretty incomplete at the moment
* Achievement Unlocker should be about finished 

# Achievement Unlocker 
* Pulls achievements data into a listview
* Double click an achievement to unlock
* Works for all games
* Unlock all achievements for any game
* Unlock all avatar awards for any game
* Unlock all gamer pics for any game

# In progress/Future plans
* Universal Leaderboard editor
  - I have been working on figuring out how people are doing the leaderboard hacks and finally have a working method that should work for most games with leaderboards that are still online. Right now it will hook the function that writes the stats and replace all int32 and int64 values in the stats struct to max or custom values. Will work on other data types next for things like time trials.
 
* Slowly adding call of duty just to be more of a complete all in one tool. I don't have any interest in cod or making anything new for it at the moment so I will add what I already have in other tools.
