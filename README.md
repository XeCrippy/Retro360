# Retro360 WinUI C++
Xbox 360 RGH/Jtag modding tool. Mainly focused on single player/offline games. 

This project started out just for testing. I was making a c++ version of JRPC and testing on a few different UI frameworks. Originally was using Dear ImGui but liked the look and feel of WinUI better. 

Current Features:
* Achievement Manager - Unlock all achievements, unlock individual achievements (optionally with custom timestamp), unlock all avatar awards, unlock all gamer pics
* File Manager - Browse, launch, send, and receive files/directories
* Memory Search - cheat engine style search tool inspired by XeClutch's Xbox 360 Cheat Engine and X360 Trainer Tool
* Some random game mods. Focusing mainly on single player games and games that haven't already been modded to death

Info:
* Using WinUI 3 in Visual Studio 2022 preview written in C++.
* This is mostly educational, trying to learn more about c++ coming from c#
* This is a work in progress and very incomplete at the moment
* Achievement Unlocker should be about finished 

# Achievement Unlocker 
* Pulls achievements data into a listview
* Double click an achievement to unlock
* Works for all games
* Unlock all achievements for any game
* Unlock all avatar awards for any game
* Unlock all gamer pics for any game
