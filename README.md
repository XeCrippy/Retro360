# Retro360

*This is just hosting the app download/installer, not the source code

Xbox 360 RGH/Jtag modding tool. Mainly focused on single player/offline games. 

Info:
* Using WinUI 3 in Visual Studio 2022 preview written in C++. 
* This is mostly educational, trying to learn more about c++ coming from c#
* The main memory/rpc library is pure c++ and uses socket connection and no xbox sdk libraries. This limits some things but I have most things working with the help of JRPC2.xex. It will still require xbdm.xex and JRPC2.xex as plugins and it is using jrpc on the console side for function calls and some of the console commands like XNotify and GetCpuKey.
* This is a work in progress and very incomplete at the moment
